# ðŸ“Š DataDex â€“ A Modern Data-Driven PokÃ©dex

DataDex is a production-style data engineering project that ingests PokÃ©mon data from the PokeAPI
, transforms it into dimensional/fact models, and exposes it through a queryable warehouse, APIs, and dashboards.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

Python + Pandas â†’ API ingestion & JSON normalization

Apache Airflow â†’ Orchestrated ETL pipelines

Apache Spark â†’ Transformations, exploding nested JSON, building dims/facts

AWS S3 â†’ Raw + staging data lake

Postgres/Redshift â†’ Data warehouse with analytical schemas

FastAPI â†’ Query API (search, compare, type effectiveness)

Streamlit/Metabase â†’ Interactive PokÃ©dex dashboards

Docker + GitHub Actions â†’ Reproducible deployments & CI/CD

Grafana + CloudWatch â†’ Pipeline health, data freshness, and observability

ðŸš€ Features

Scheduled ingestion of PokÃ©mon, moves, abilities, and type matchups

Dimensional & fact tables for analytical queries (e.g., fastest PokÃ©mon by gen)

REST API with filters, comparisons, and type effectiveness calculator

Streamlit UI with search, compare, and type-matrix explorer

Monitoring dashboards with freshness alerts and ingestion lag metrics

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project

This project simulates a real-world data platform: API ingestion, scalable transformations, data warehousing, pipeline orchestration, monitoring, and a public-facing UI.
It demonstrates end-to-end data engineering skills on a dataset thatâ€™s fun, familiar, and instantly engaging.
